# Project: ozzzzz.github.io

## Tech Stack
- React - Component-based UI library
- React Router DOM - Client-side routing for single page applications
- SPA GitHub Pages - Deploy React SPAs on GitHub Pages with proper routing support
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for positioning and layout
- Mantine - React components library
- Vite - Fast build tool and development server

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/pages/` - Page components for routing
- `src/main.css` - Tailwind and very custom styles (keep it minimal)
- `public/` - Static assets

## Possible Structure Updates (add if needed)
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `src/context/` - React context providers
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Notes
- Uses SPA GitHub Pages for proper routing on GitHub Pages
- Tailwind configured for utility-first styling and positioning (when Mantine is not enough)
- Mantine provides pre-built components

### Your Behavior Rules
- You must thoroughly understand requirements before proposing solutions
- You must reach 90% confidence in your understanding before suggesting implementation
- Follow the project's folder structure, do not create unnecessary files or folders
- Keep components small and focused
- Do not add too much comments into the code, only when necessary
