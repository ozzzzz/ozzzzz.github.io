## Experience

### Senion software developer

👉 [FunkFlow](https://www.funkflow.com/) / _Belgrade, Serbia_

⏱️ 05.2024 – current time

🔧 Python, React, Rhino + Grasshopper, RFEM6

I worked on developing services and algorithms to speed up the building construction process, starting from the project brief, through exploring structural options, and finishing with prefabrication in the factory. This involved studying the physics of load-bearing structures and using FEM analysis tools like RFEM to ensure safety and optimize structural performance.

I also focused on making workflows more efficient and integrating designs with prefabrication needs to ensure smooth transitions between design and factory production.

### Software developer

👉 [Nortal](https://nortal.com/) / _Belgrade, Serbia_

⏱️ 08.2022 – 05.2024

🔧 Python, Spark, React, Kubernetes, Kafka, Keycloak

I contributed to the development of the digital core for NEOM city. I collaborated with other developers to create a microservice system, ensuring that the architecture diagram was always current and facilitating knowledge sharing within the team. This collaboration was crucial in maintaining a cohesive and efficient development process.

Furthermore, I developed backend systems and assisted in mobile development for various applications designed for NEOM Airport. These applications were developed in a very short period of time and successfully released.

### Senior software developer

👉 [The Anylogic Company](https://www.anylogic.com/) / _Saint-Petersburg, Russia_

⏱️ 09.2021 – 08.2022 / _11 months_

🔧 Java, Python, Docker, Gitlab, NSIS

Played a key role in redesigning a standalone application for all OS platforms with a 20-year history of development.

Fixed a bottleneck in the development and release pipeline by setting new a new IaC infrastructure and build pipeline, based on Gitlab solution.

### Head of bioinformatics software development group

👉 [BIOCAD](https://biocad.ru/) / _Saint-Petersburg, Russia_

⏱️ 02.2019 – 08.2021 / _2 years 7 months_

🔧 Haskell, Python, React, RabbitMQ, Gitlab, Kubernetes

Our team developed two dedicated services for storing and connecting diverse biological data generated during drug discovery, including antibodies, plasmids, viruses, clustering results, sequence annotations, and so on.

We also have developed a couple of dozen algorithms for labs that simplify and speed up the process from computer-based sequences to physical proteins or viruses. Additionally, we created a lab-friendly service with a React and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) frontend, incorporating Haskell and Python algorithms that operate across multiple servers through the Kubernetes queue and API.

### Lead software developer

👉 [BIOCAD](https://biocad.ru/) / _Saint-Petersburg, Russia_

⏱️ 01.2018 – 01.2019 / _1 year 1 month_

🔧 Haskell, Python, Neo4j, Mongo

Developed an algorithm to find valid details in other 3D structures for inspiration in rational [_in silico_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico) modeling, utilizing the entire [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) database. A poster with this algorithm was presented at [PEGS 2019](https://www.pegsummit.com/19#).

Collaborated with the Matrosov Institute for System Dynamics and Control Theory to create optimization methods, enabling faster identification of local extremum in protein structures compared to standard approaches. Published the article "Algorithms for local minimization of 3D molecules OPLS force field" (see below in the articles).

Led a team in creating a project management service using MongoDB and Haskell on the backend, along with React on the frontend, to streamline projects coordination.

### Senior software developer

👉 [BIOCAD](https://biocad.ru/) / _Saint-Petersburg, Russia_

⏱️ 01.2017 – 12.2017 / _1 year_

🔧 Haskell, Python, ZeroMQ, Neo4j

Together with my team, we created an algorithm for the [protein folding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding). The quality of the resulting 3D antibody structure prediction algorithm is comparable to [Rosetta Software](https://www.rosettacommons.org/software) and [Schrödinger Software](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/prime).

Created a message bus for efficient task distribution based on ZeroMQ with bindings for Haskell and Python.

### Software developer

👉 [BIOCAD](https://biocad.ru/) / _Saint-Petersburg, Russia_

⏱️ 05.2016 – 12.2016 / _8 months_

🔧 Scala, Julia, MySQL, Docker

Wrote in Scala:

- backend for a service for storing and connecting various biological items
- backend for a proprietary authorization and authotication system that was only changed to [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and [Azure](azure.microsoft.com) in 2019
- [Sun Grid Engine](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/0.93.3/guides/sge.html)-based solution for high-load server
